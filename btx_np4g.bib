    abstract = { Fifty years ago, Newell and Simon (1956) invented a “thinking machine” called the Logic Theorist. The Logic Theorist was a computer program that could prove theorems in symbolic logic from Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica. This was perhaps the first working program that simulated some aspects of peoples' ability to solve complex problems. The Logic Theorist and other cognitive simulations developed by Newell and Simon in the late 1950s had a large impact on the newly developing field of information-processing (or cognitive) psychology. Many of the novel ideas about mental representation and problem solving instantiated in the Logic Theorist are still a central part of the theory of cognitive psychology, and are still used in modeling the complex tasks studied in human factors psychology. This paper presents some of the theoretical precursors of the Logic Theorist, describes the principles and implementation of the program, and discusses its immediate and long-term impacts. }

    title = "Genetic network programming - application to intelligent agents",
    abstract = "Recently many studies have been made on automatic design of the complex systems by using the evolutionary optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolution Strategy (ES), Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Genetic Programming (GP). It is generally recognized that these techniques are very useful for optimizing fairly complex systems such as generation of intelligent behavior sequences of robots. In this paper, a new method named Genetic network Programming (GNP) is proposed in order to acquire these behavior sequences efficiently. GNP is composed of plural nodes for agents to execute simple judgment/processing and they are connected with each other to form a network structure. Agents behave according to the contents of the nodes and their connections in GNP. In order to obtain better structure, GNP changes itself by using evolutionary optimization techniques.",
